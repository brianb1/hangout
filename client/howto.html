	<h2>THIS IS A REALLY COOL THING</h2>
	<h3><i>Here's what it does:</i></h3>
		<p>Hangout helps facilitate one-on-one hangouts between people that might not have ever invited each other to hang out.</p>
	<h3><i>Here's why it exists:</i></h3>
	<p>I love spending time with people. I believe that spending time one-on-one with someone else, hanging out and discussing life, is one of the most valuable things a person can do. I also believe that everyone has a story, whether or not they thing they do, and that once you know someone's story it's hard not to like them. These are things that I am reminded of every time I spend a sufficient amount of time alone with someone new.</p>
	<p>I know from my own life how easy it can be to just hang out with established friends, and how intimidating it can be to reach out to someone new. I created Hangout to solve that problem. Hangout is (at least for now) strictly for use within existing groups of people (fraternities and sororities, student groups and clubs, companies, college dorm floors/halls, etc.). I am limiting Hangout in this way because I want people to use it to strengthen the weaker relationships in their existing social groups and to help kill the clicky-ness that is always present in sufficiently large groups.</p> 
	<h3><i>Here's how to use it:</i></h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Compare the Hangout calendar with your personal calendar.</li>
		<li>If you have a gap on your personal calendar that matches up with an existing event on the Hangout calendar, click on that hangout to join it and skip to step 5</li>
		<li>Otherwise, add an event or two to the Hangout calendar that correspond to gaps on your personal calendar.</li>
		<li>Wait for someone to join your hangout.</li>
		<li>Hangout.</li>
	</ol>
