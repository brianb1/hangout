Problems
	To be most effective, users must manually add their hangouts to their personal calendars as well. This is an inconvenience.

Thoughts
	I would like to ditch the messages page, both to keep the product simple and to remove the possibility of users learning who they're going to hang out with by their messages. One option would be to have messages go through an email system similar to what craigslist does. That would solve the simplicity issue, but would do nothing to solve the other issue.
